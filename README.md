# Stampr: A Re-implementation of the STAMP computational protocols.

This repository contains my attempt to understand and use the ideas
from the various stamp papers.  My attempts were helped tremendously
by the gift of the original implementation scripts from the authors;
portions of which are included in the vignette, which may be checked
out via:

```{r vignette}
library(stampr)
